# Best practices for GUI automation with PyAutoGUI
# 1. Coordinate Calibration: Use position() to verify coords on different screens.
# 2. Use Relative Moves: moveRel instead of absolute coords for flexible layouts.
# 3. Image Confidence: Adjust confidence for faster or more accurate matches.
# 4. Logging: Add print() or use logging to trace script progress.
# 5. Modularize: Wrap tasks in functions like click_button(), type_text().
