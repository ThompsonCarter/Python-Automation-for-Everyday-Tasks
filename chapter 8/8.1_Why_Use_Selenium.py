# Why Use Selenium?
# JavaScript-driven sites: scrape or automate SPAs.
# Complex workflows: login-protected pages, multi-step forms.
# Testing & monitoring: simulate user journeys.

# Selenium controls real browsers (Chrome, Firefox), giving you full fidelity, unlike simple requests-based scraping.
